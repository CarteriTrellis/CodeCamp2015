# Seattle Code Camp 2015
Slides, the as-prepared script, and code samples for "Their Exits and Their Entrances: Actors in the .NET Framework"

Before running the code samples, please check out the file "Software Instructions" in the docs directory.

Additionally, there are reference materials for my sources (both my images and my presentation), and a "cheat sheet" code listing that is mentioned in the as-prepared script during the code example as [step 1], [step 2], and so on.
