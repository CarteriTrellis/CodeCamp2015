# CodeCamp2015
Slides, the as-prepared script, and code samples for "Their Exits and Their Entrances: Actors in the .NET Framework"

Additionally, there are reference materials for my sources (both my images and my presentation), and a "cheat sheet" code listing that is mentioned in the as-prepared script during the code example as [step 1], [step 2], and so on.
